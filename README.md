I hold a degree in Environmental Science and Natural Resource Management, and I have distinguished myself through my passionate commitment to research and the sustainable management of natural resources. I am proficient in a wide range of software and tools for the collection, processing, and visualization of spatial and non-spatial data, including Kobo Toolbox, Survey123, ODK, FieldMaps, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Erdas Imagine, ENVI, Maxent, Spatial Lite, Power BI, R (RStudio and Shiny dashboards), Python, Google Earth Pro, and GeoApp. My expertise also encompasses advanced spatial data visualization software and techniques, such as ArcGIS dashboards, StoryMaps, Tableau, and interactive 3D modeling. I am also skilled in spatial epidemiology modeling techniques using RStudio and Python, utilizing libraries such as EPIcontact, Epidynamics, Epidm, Epimodel, EpiEstim, Epitools, and EpiNoW2. These skills enable me to seamlessly integrate data collection, analysis, and visualization workflows to address complex challenges in the fields of biodiversity conservation, spatial epidemiology, environmental monitoring, and crisis and disaster management.
